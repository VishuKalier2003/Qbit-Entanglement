The Project explains the <b><i>Quantum Computation</i></b>. The project takes the simplistic approach of ***Quantum Superposition and Quantum Entanglement*** on two Qbits. Thus, the project provides a basic insight about the approaches of Quantum Mechanics with minimum detailing. The below ***Project Table*** gives the status of Completion about various subfolders of the Project.
